### Welcome

I lead the end-to-end design and delivery of research instruments and hardware–software platforms. Across my neuroscience PhD and a biomedical engineering postdoc, I’ve scoped, architected, built, and validated **more than ten instruments in active use**, including **three standalone behavioral systems** released as open source.

On the science side, my work and publications span methods and translational research anchored in brain networks and behavior, with focus areas in:

- navigation  
- aging and neurodegeneration  
- computational modeling  

I’ve authored two funded project grants, served as the academic lead on three industry collaborations, and led cross-functional teams across multiple projects.

My focus now is channeling a cross-domain generalist skill set into roles and ventures with wider impact, including an early-stage UBC-campus spinout bringing open-source lab instruments from release to deployment.

#### Scope

- Conceive and design experiments  
- Design and build custom instruments and closed-loop behavioral platforms  
- Develop end-to-end software stacks (firmware, I/O, runtime control, UI)  
- Perform quantitative analysis, modeling, and visualization  
- Publish methods and research, and release tools as open source  

#### Focus areas

- methods and instrumentation  
- spatial navigation, aging, and neurodegeneration  
- psychedelics and translational applications

### Welcome

I design and deliver research instruments and hardware–software platforms for neuroscience and biomedical engineering. Across my PhD and postdoc work, I’ve developed more than ten instruments now in active use, including three open-source behavioral systems.

*Research hypotheses → custom instruments → working experiments → publication and open release*

This site collects a subset of that work:

- behavioral platforms for rodent navigation and touchscreen tasks  
- modular subsystems and implants for neural recording and control  
- open-source releases with CAD, firmware, code, and replication assets
