# Roller-Bearing Cable Guide

<div class="content-groups">
<div class="content-group content-group-primary" markdown="1">

## Description
Designed for linear-track experiments, this guide prevents torsion on the headstage cable while allowing smooth travel along the track. A collet mounted in a roller bearing isolates twist from the signal cable as the animal runs, and the carriage rides on dual stainless-steel rails using adjustable plastic roller bearings for quiet motion.

## Validation & Performance

**Stable use:**  
In-rig and in vivo use with stable recordings for 2 experiments and 3 rigs.

## Materials & Fabrication

**Housing and collet:**  
SLA-printed resin two-part housing and two-part collet

**Rails:**  
1/2 in diameter stainless-steel rails, 4 ft length

**Bearings:**  
- Plastic races with 316 stainless balls
- 3/4 in ID × 1.625 in OD and 1/8 in ID × 0.375 in OD

**Hardware:**  
#4-40 stainless bolts with nylon-insert lock nuts and #4 washers for roller assemblies

## Release

- **CAD:** STEP files available in portfolio (see 3D Model Files)
- **On request:** additional design files

## References

## Role & Contributions
- Designed and fabricated all components
- Integrated into linear-track recording rigs

## Highlights & Key Specs

**Cable interface:**  
- Collet accommodates 3/16 in cable
- Twist isolation via roller bearing
- Intended for use downstream of a commutator to minimize cable torsion

**Bearings:**  
- Plastic roller bearings on rails
- Internal roller bearing at collet
- Guide travels along two 4 ft, 1/2 in diameter stainless-steel rails

**Serviceability:**  
- Field-adjustable preload on roller bearings
- Standard hand tools

## Deployment & Status

**Development:**  
Completed, Jan 2018–Feb 2018

**Deployment:**  
Barnes Lab, University of Arizona (2 studies; 3 rigs)

**Status:**  
Active, Feb 2018–present, Barnes Lab
