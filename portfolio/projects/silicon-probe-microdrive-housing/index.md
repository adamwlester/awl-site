## Description

The housing is compatible with the 128-channel SpikeGadgets Horizontal Headstage and Cambridge Neurotech ASSY-236 F probes, and incorporates the Cambridge Neurotech NanoDrive for probe positioning. A custom probe interface PCB provides electrical interconnect and mechanical support between the probe and headstage. The three-part SLA-printed resin housing uses standard #0-80 fasteners for straightforward fabrication, assembly, and maintenance. Fine adjustment is achieved by accessing the NanoDrive through a top access hole that isolates the lead screw from probe components, providing approximately 6 mm of travel. The headstage clips into place on the back of the housing, angled at 10° to allow free head movement. The detachable base of the housing provides an adhesion point for surgical cement and enables easy extraction of the intact probe and main housing body for reuse.
