## Description

This mount was designed for use with another portfolio project: the [Omniroute Maze System](https://www.cadcrowd.com/3d-models/omniroute-maze-system).

The mount provides independent height and yaw adjustment to align a short-throw projector for visual cue delivery on the Omniroute maze. A horizontal 80/20 1020 boom, attached to ceiling strut channels, connects to a vertical 80/20 1020 upright via a pair of 80/20 angle plates. Height is set by loosening the angle-plate fasteners, sliding the upright along the boom, then retightening.

At the projector end, a waterjet-cut three-plate yaw assembly provides ±30° rotation. The frame-mount plate carries a pivot plate with an arc slot and degree markings. The projector-interface plate clamps to the pivot assembly with three 1/4-20 wing-head thumb screws for toolless, secure, repeatable yaw adjustment. The projector-interface plate is drilled for the Mi 4K Laser Projector.
