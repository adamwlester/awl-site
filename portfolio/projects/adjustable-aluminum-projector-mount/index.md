## Description

This mount was designed for use with another portfolio project: the [Omniroute Maze System](https://www.cadcrowd.com/3d-models/omniroute-maze-system).

The mount provides independent height and yaw adjustment to align a short-throw projector for visual cue delivery on the Omniroute maze. A horizontal 80/20 1020 boom, attached to ceiling strut channels, connects to a vertical 80/20 1020 upright via a pair of 80/20 angle plates. Height is set by loosening the angle-plate fasteners, sliding the upright along the boom, then retightening.

At the projector end, a waterjet-cut three-plate yaw assembly provides ±30° rotation. The frame-mount plate carries a pivot plate with an arc slot and degree markings. The projector-interface plate clamps to the pivot assembly with three 1/4-20 wing-head thumb screws for toolless, secure, repeatable yaw adjustment. The projector-interface plate is drilled for the Mi 4K Laser Projector.

## Role & Contributions

- Conceived and developed all CAD models and assemblies
- Integrated with Omniroute system and maintained in routine use

## Highlights & Key Specs

**Adjustments:**  
- Independent yaw via 1/4-20 wing-head thumb screws over ±30°  
- Vertical adjustment along an 80/20 1020 T-slot rail  

**Mounting interface:**  
- Projector-interface plate drilled for Mi 4K Laser Projector  
- Can be re-patterned for other models  

**Installation:**  
- Standard hand tools  
- Toolless yaw  
- Secure, repeatable adjustment  

## Materials & Fabrication

**Plates:**  
- Waterjet-cut 1/4 in 6061 aluminum with tapped holes  

**Rails:**  
- 80/20 1020 T-slot extrusion (upright and boom)  

**Hardware:**  
- 1/4-20 stainless fasteners with roll-in T-nuts  
- Two 80/20 angle plates (4151)  
- Three 1/4-20 wing-head thumb screws
