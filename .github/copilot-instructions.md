<!-- Purpose: concise, repo-specific guidance for AI coding agents -->
# Copilot instructions — adamwlester-site

Purpose: Help an AI coding agent be immediately productive in this repository.

- **Big picture:** This repo is a content-driven Jekyll site (GitHub Pages). The repo root is the site root. Project pages live under `portfolio/projects/<slug>/index.md` and are the single source of truth for each project (front matter + Markdown body). See `README.md` at repo root for the full site and publishing notes.

- **Key files / locations (in progress):**
  - `README.md` — high-level architecture, naming conventions, and media constraints. This is the first place to look for repo context for now.
  - `portfolio/projects/<slug>/index.md` — project content (front matter fields: `title`, `summary`, `hero`, `images`, `models`).
  - `docs/_hidden` — do not use any content in here for context.
