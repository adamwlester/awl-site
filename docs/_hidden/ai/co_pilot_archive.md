# 1: Scaffolding

You are operating in the root of my website repo.

Task:
Inside the existing folder `portfolio/projects/`, create one folder for each of the following slugs:

- roller-bearing-cable-guide
- dual-bundle-electrode-drive
- silicon-probe-microdrive-housing
- fischer-344-rat-model
- wireless-mobile-feeder-robot
- adjustable-aluminum-projector-mount
- two-axis-feeder-gantry
- nc4gate-automatable-gate-module
- track-mounted-feeder-cart
- instantaneous-cue-rotation-icr-arena
- omniroute-maze-system
- nc4touch-behavioral-apparatus

For EACH of these project folders, do the following:
1. Ensure there is an `images/` subfolder.
2. Ensure there is a `models/` subfolder.
3. Create an empty `index.md` file directly inside the project folder (alongside `images` and `models`), if it does not already exist.

Constraints / guardrails:
- Only modify the `portfolio/projects/` directory and its subfolders.
- Do NOT rename or delete any existing files or folders.
- If any of these folders, subfolders, or `index.md` files already exist, leave their existing contents as-is.
- Use relative paths from the repo root, not absolute system paths.

When you’re done, show me the final directory tree for `portfolio/projects/`.

# 2: Stuff


I think you have it.

Now, can you rewrite this section, being careful to use the terms we have established. Get the elements and layout clear. What I want is for you to write out what I have already in a normal out of code block response and bold the parts you think need to be changed. Then explain why.


Review my makdwown up to this point. I need to start adding to the "Project List Page Overview" section. Please take a look at the wireframe and see if you can parse the details of what I am after for this page. We want to use a similar structure to "Project Detail Page Overview" but it should be easier to outline this page.
