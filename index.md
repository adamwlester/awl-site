### I’m a systems neuroscientist with a thing for messy systems and clean instruments.

PhD neuroscientist and biomedical engineering postdoc at UBC’s School of Biomedical Engineering. I lead the end-to-end design and delivery of research instruments and hardware–software platforms, from concept through deployment in active studies.

*Research hypotheses → custom instruments → working experiments → publication and open release*

I’ve scoped, architected, built, and validated more than ten instruments in active use, including three standalone behavioral systems released as open source. My work spans methods and translational research anchored in brain networks and behavior, with focus areas in:

- *research instrumentation, behavioral platforms, and closed-loop systems*
- *embedded control, robotics, and electrophysiology workflows*
- *spatial navigation, memory, and aging*
- *neurodegeneration and translational neuroscience*
- *computational modeling and psychedelics*

My focus now is channeling a cross-domain generalist skill set into roles and ventures with wider impact, including an early-stage UBC-campus spinout bringing open-source lab instruments from release to deployment.
