Welcome — I lead the end-to-end design and delivery of **research instruments** and **hardware–software platforms**.  

Across my neuroscience PhD and a biomedical engineering postdoc, I’ve scoped, architected, built, and validated **more than ten instruments in active use**, including **three standalone behavioral systems released as open source**.

On the science side, my work and publications span methods and translational research anchored in **brain networks and behavior**, with focus areas in **navigation**, **aging**, **neurodegeneration**, and **computational modeling**. I’ve authored **two funded project grants**, served as the academic lead on **three industry collaborations**, and led cross-functional teams across multiple projects.

My focus now is channeling a **cross-domain generalist** skill set into roles and ventures with wider impact, including an early-stage UBC-campus spinout bringing open-source lab instruments from release to deployment.
